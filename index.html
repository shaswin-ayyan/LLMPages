<h2>ashravan.txt - Short story about Ashravan</h2>
<pre class="border p-3 bg-light" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Brandon Sanderson's tale continues as Ashravan awakens, eyes flickering with new life. The restoration process, led by Shai, was more than a mere spell—it was a rebirth, a chance to forge a new destiny. Ashravan, once a hero fallen by treachery, now faces a world he barely recognizes. His memories flood back, each more haunting than the last.

He seeks out his companions, finding them in the ruins of their once-glorious city. They are wary, but hope flickers when they see him alive. Shadowy figures lurk in the background, remnants of those who betrayed him. As Ashravan unravels the truth, he discovers a conspiracy that threatens to undo everything.

The climax approaches as Ashravan confronts the mastermind, a figure cloaked in darkness, wielding forbidden power. The battle is fierce—a clash of magic and will. In a moment of sacrifice, Ashravan taps into his newfound strength, channeling the combined power of his allies. Victory is within reach, but at a cost.

The story closes with Ashravan standing amidst the ruins, resolute. His journey is far from over, but he is reborn—ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, driven by hope and the unbreakable bonds of friendship.</pre>
